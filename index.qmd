## Healthcare Facility Transmission {.smaller}

- Patient-to-patient transmission is important but difficult to document
  - Inpatient with infection onset may have acquired organism before or after admission
  - Extent to which transmission-interrupting interventions will reduce infections is unclear

- **Transmission threshold** effects may be especially important
  - Can a single high-transmission facility sustain/amplify transmission by itself
($R_0>1$)?
  - Interventions that reduce $R_0<1$ can be highly impactful and cost-beneficial

- Mathematical models can help address these topics
