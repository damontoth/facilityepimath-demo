## Healthcare Facility Transmission {.smaller}

-   Patient-to-patient transmission is important but difficult to document
    -   Inpatient with infection onset may have acquired organism before or after admission
    -   Extent to which transmission-interrupting interventions will reduce infections is unclear
-   **Transmission threshold** effects may be especially important
    -   Can a single high-transmission facility sustain/amplify transmission by itself (within-faciliy $R_0>1$)?
    -   Interventions that reduce $R_0<1$ can be highly impactful and cost-beneficial
-   Mathematical models can help address these topics

## Differential equation model {.smaller}

General model for two "colonized" compartments $C_1$ and $C_2$ and two "susceptible" compartments $S_1$ and $S_2$

$\frac{dS_1}{dt} = -(s_{21}+(a_{11}+a_{21})\alpha+\omega_1+h(t))S_1 + s{12}S_2 + r_{11}C_1 + r_{12}C_2$

$\frac{dS_2}{dt} = s_{21}S_1 - (s_{12}+(a_{12}+a_{22})\alpha+\omega_2+h(t))S_2 + r_{21}C_1 + r_{22}C_2$

$\frac{dC_1}{dt} = a_{11}\alpha S_1 + a_{12}\alpha S_2 - (c_{21}+r_{11}+r_{21}+\omega_3+h(t))C_1 + c_{12}C_2$

$\frac{dC_2}{dt} = a_{21}\alpha S_1 + a_{22}\alpha S_2 + c_{21}C_1 - (c_{12}+r_{12}+r_{22}+\omega_4+h(t))C_2$

The acquisition rate $\alpha$ in each equation: $\alpha = \beta_1 C_1 + \beta_2 C_2$

Transition rates among the susceptible, colonized states: $s_{ij}$, $c_{ij}$

Colonization clearance rates and $C$-to-$S$ transitions: $r_{ij}$

Relative susceptibility and $S$-to-$C$ transitions: $a_{ij}$

State-dependent removal (death or discharge) rates: $\omega_i$

State-independent, time-of-stay-dependent removal hazard: $h(t)$
